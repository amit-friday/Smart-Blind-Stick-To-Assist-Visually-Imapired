”Smart cane for assisting visually impaired people”
Our device is a low cost and lightweight system that processes signals and alerts the visually impaired over any obstacle, potholes or
water puddles through different beeping patterns. It senses the light intensity of the environment and illuminates the LED accordingly. 
These are accomplished by incorporating two ultrasonic sensors, a moisture sensor and a LDR sensor along with an Arduino Nano micro-controller. These
are placed at specific positions of the cane for efficient guidance. Moreover, a GSM module is also added to the system so that the
visually impaired person can send a message to the emergency contact number in case of distress.
